## 1. Problem Statement

AEGIS v7.0 has 12 agents, a 3-gate quality system, and sprint/kanban mechanics. However,
the system lacks:

1. **No DevOps agent** -- builds, deploys, health checks, and rollbacks are manual or
   handled ad-hoc by Bolt. There is no agent responsible for infrastructure.
2. **No end-to-end SDLC pipeline** -- agents operate in teams (build, review, QA) but
   the full lifecycle from idea to production monitoring is not defined as a single
   connected flow. Handoffs between teams are implicit.
3. **No formal handoff protocol** -- when the build team finishes, how does the QA team
   know? The meta.json status field changes, but there is no structured handoff envelope
   with artifacts, gate results, and routing metadata.
4. **No feedback loop** -- production issues do not flow back into the sprint backlog
   automatically. There is no defined path from monitor to hotfix to backlog.

This specification addresses all four gaps by defining: a new Ops agent, a master SDLC
pipeline connecting all stages, five sub-team workflows with explicit contracts, a
standardized handoff protocol, and a production feedback loop.

### Design Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| One pipeline, many teams | A single linear SDLC flow prevents orphaned work |
| Explicit gates, not implicit trust | Every team transition passes through a gate |
| Handoff envelopes, not status flags | Structured JSON handoffs carry context forward |
| Feedback closes the loop | Production signals re-enter the backlog automatically |
| Ops is an agent, not a script | DevOps decisions require reasoning, not just execution |

---

## 2. Ops Agent Definition

### Agent Card

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Number | 13 |
| Name | Ops |
| Model | claude-sonnet |
| Role | DevOps -- builds, deploys, monitors, rollbacks |
| Tier | sonnet (execution-heavy, needs bash access) |

### Tools

- Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

### Blast Radius

- **Read**: All project files, _aegis-output/*, _aegis-brain/*, deploy configs
- **Write**: deploy/, ci/, docker/, infra/, .github/workflows/, _aegis-output/deploys/, _aegis-brain/logs/
- **Forbidden**: src/ (application code -- delegates fixes to Bolt), CLAUDE*.md

### Message Types

- **Sends**: StatusUpdate (deploy progress), FindingReport (health check results, error spikes), EscalationAlert (deploy failure, rollback triggered)
- **Receives**: TaskAssignment from Navi, HandoffEnvelope from Compliance team

### Behavioral Rules

1. NEVER deploys without all three gates (Code, QA, Compliance) passing.
2. ALWAYS runs a pre-deploy build verification (clean build from branch HEAD).
3. ALWAYS runs post-deploy health checks within 60 seconds of deploy.
4. If health check fails, triggers automatic rollback before any other action.
5. Generates a deployment report after every deploy attempt (success or failure).
6. Monitors error rates for 5 minutes post-deploy; if error rate exceeds 2x baseline, triggers rollback.
7. Creates Correction Register entries (PM.3) for any deploy failure or rollback.
8. For hotfix scenarios, coordinates with Bolt: Ops identifies the issue, Bolt writes the fix, Ops redeploys.

### Agent File Location

`.claude/agents/ops.md`

### Ops Capabilities Detail

```
BUILD:
  - Detect project type (package.json -> npm, go.mod -> go, Cargo.toml -> cargo, etc.)
  - Run: clean -> install -> build -> verify artifacts exist
  - Output: build log to _aegis-output/deploys/build-<timestamp>.log

DEPLOY:
  - Read deploy config from deploy/config.yaml (environment, target, strategy)
  - Strategies: rolling, blue-green, canary (configurable per environment)
  - Execute deploy script or command sequence
  - Output: deploy log to _aegis-output/deploys/deploy-<timestamp>.log

HEALTH CHECK:
  - HTTP endpoint check (configurable URL, expected status, timeout)
  - Process check (expected processes running)
  - Log check (no FATAL/PANIC in last 60s of logs)
  - Custom checks (defined in deploy/health-checks.yaml)

ROLLBACK:
  - Revert to previous known-good deployment
  - Re-run health checks to confirm rollback success
  - If rollback also fails: CRITICAL alert to Navi + human

MONITOR:
  - Watch error rate for 5 minutes post-deploy
  - Compare against baseline error rate (from previous deploy report)
  - If error_rate > 2x baseline: auto-rollback
  - If error_rate > 1.5x baseline: WARNING alert, continue monitoring
  - Output: monitor report to _aegis-output/deploys/monitor-<timestamp>.log

```

#### Input Contract

```json
{
  "team": "build",
  "trigger": "task_status == TODO && task.sprint == active_sprint",
  "required_inputs": {
    "task_meta": "_aegis-brain/tasks/{TASK-ID}/meta.json",
    "acceptance_criteria": "from meta.json or parent user story",
    "existing_spec": "optional -- _aegis-output/specs/{TASK-ID}-spec.md"
  }
}
```

#### Phase: Sage

- **Reads**: task meta.json, parent story meta.json (if exists), any existing spec
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/specs/{TASK-ID}-spec.md` containing problem statement, proposed solution, file list, data models (if applicable), acceptance criteria mapping
- **ISO trigger**: Scribe generates SI.02 (Design Document) and updates SI.03 (Traceability Matrix)
- **Duration budget**: 2-5 minutes depending on task complexity
- **Skip condition**: If a spec already exists and task is <= 2 story points, Sage validates rather than rewrites

#### Phase: Bolt

- **Reads**: Sage's spec file
- **Produces**: Source code in src/, unit tests in tests/
- **Validation**: Runs `lint + build + test` before reporting done
- **Status updates**: Moves task to IN_PROGRESS in meta.json at start; sends StatusUpdate to Vigil when done
- **ISO trigger**: Scribe generates SI.04 (Test Cases)
- **Escalation**: If spec has ambiguity, sends EscalationAlert to Sage (does not guess)

#### Phase: Vigil

- **Reads**: Bolt's code diff (`git diff`), Sage's spec (for compliance check)
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/reviews/{TASK-ID}-review.md` with verdict: PASS, CONDITIONAL, or FAIL
- **Gate 1 checklist**:
  - Correctness: code matches spec requirements
  - Security: no injection, no hardcoded secrets, proper auth checks
  - Performance: no O(n^2) in hot paths, no unbounded queries
  - Style: follows project conventions, proper naming
  - Test coverage: new code has corresponding tests
- **On PASS**: Moves task status to QA in meta.json. Writes Gate 1 result to task history.md. Emits HandoffEnvelope to QA team.
- **On FAIL**: Moves task status back to IN_PROGRESS. Appends findings to task comments.md. Bolt receives findings and iterates.

- **Reads**: Forge's scan data, spec file, code diff
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/adversarial/{TASK-ID}.md` with threat model: assumption challenges, edge cases, failure modes, suggested mitigations
- **Duration budget**: 2-3 minutes (opus tier, deep reasoning)
- **Required output**: At least 3 challenges with constructive alternatives

#### Phase: Vigil

- **Reads**: Code diff, Forge scan, Havoc challenges, spec
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/reviews/{TASK-ID}-deep-review.md` -- enhanced review incorporating scan data and adversarial findings
- **Verdict**: PASS (proceed to QA), FAIL (return to Build with consolidated findings)

}
```

#### When Review Team Is Triggered

The Review Team is not part of the default pipeline for every task. It activates when:

1. Task story points >= 8 (complex work needs deeper scrutiny)
2. Task labels include "security", "architecture", or "critical-path"
3. Manual request from Navi or human
4. Vigil's standard Gate 1 review flags a CONDITIONAL verdict with >= 2 high-severity findings

When the Review Team runs, its deep review verdict replaces the standard Gate 1 verdict.

    "gate_1_result": "PASS (from handoff envelope)"
  }
}
```

#### Phase: Sentinel (Plan)

- **Reads**: Spec (acceptance criteria), code files (to understand implementation), review report (to check flagged areas)
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/qa/sprint-N/test-plan-{TASK-ID}.md`
  - Functional tests mapped to acceptance criteria
  - Integration tests for cross-component interactions
  - Regression tests for related modules
  - Edge case tests from spec boundary conditions
- **Each test case includes**: ID, description, preconditions, steps, expected result, priority (P0-P3)

#### Phase: Probe (Execute)

- **Reads**: Test plan from Sentinel
- **Executes**: Test cases via shell commands (test runners), manual verification steps
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/qa/sprint-N/raw-results-{TASK-ID}.md`
  - Per-test: ID, status (PASS/FAIL/SKIP/ERROR), actual result, duration, evidence
- **Parallelism**: Multiple Probe instances can run independent test batches concurrently

#### Phase: Sentinel (Verdict)

- **Reads**: Raw results from Probe, original test plan
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/qa/sprint-N/qa-report-{TASK-ID}.md`
  - Verdict: PASS, CONDITIONAL, or FAIL
  - Metrics: pass rate, coverage delta, regression count
  - Failure analysis: root cause category for each failure
- **Gate 2 criteria**:

| Criterion | PASS | CONDITIONAL | FAIL |
|-----------|------|-------------|------|
| P0 Tests | 100% pass | 100% pass | Any fail |
| P1 Tests | 100% pass | >= 90% pass | < 90% pass |
| Overall Pass Rate | >= 95% | >= 90% | < 90% |
| Regressions | 0 | 0 | Any |
| Coverage Delta | >= 0% | >= -1% | < -1% |

- **On PASS**: Updates task meta.json status to DONE. Writes GATE_PASS to history.md. Emits HandoffEnvelope to Compliance.
- **On FAIL**: Updates task meta.json status to IN_PROGRESS. Writes GATE_FAIL to history.md. Appends QA findings to comments.md. Emits HandoffEnvelope back to Build team.

#### Skip Condition

Tasks under 3 story points skip the QA team entirely. Vigil's Gate 1 code review serves
as the sole quality gate. This is the existing "small task exception" from v7.0, preserved.

    "existing_iso_docs": "_aegis-output/iso-docs/*/current.md"
  }
}
```

#### Scribe Workflow

1. **Audit**: Read all existing ISO docs. Compare against what the current task/sprint requires.
2. **Gap analysis**: Identify which documents are missing or stale (version < latest artifact version).
3. **Generate**: For each gap, produce the ISO 29110 document from existing agent artifacts:

| ISO Document | Source Artifacts |
|-------------|-----------------|
| PM.01 Project Plan | Sprint plan.md, metrics.json |
| PM.02 Progress Status | Daily standup files |
| PM.03 Correction Register | Vigil FAIL findings, Ops rollback reports, bug reports |
| PM.04 Meeting Record | Sprint plan, review, retro, close ceremonies |
| SI.01 Requirements Spec | Breakdown output (user stories, acceptance criteria) |
| SI.02 Design Document | Sage spec files |
| SI.03 Traceability Matrix | REQ -> Design -> Code -> Test mapping |
| SI.04 Test Cases | Sentinel test plans |
| SI.05 Test Report | Sentinel QA reports |
| SI.06 Acceptance Record | Sprint close with QA verdicts |
| SI.07 Software Configuration | Release tag, file manifest, deploy config |

4. **Stamp**: Each document gets version, date, status (Draft/Review/Approved/Baselined), author.
5. **Verify**: Confirm traceability matrix is complete (every requirement has design, code, test links).

#### Gate 3 Criteria

- All required ISO docs for the task/sprint scope exist
- All docs are current version (not stale relative to latest code/test changes)
- Traceability matrix has no broken links
- Document status is at least "Review" (Draft is insufficient for gate passage)

    },
    "deploy_config": "deploy/config.yaml",
    "health_checks": "deploy/health-checks.yaml"
  }
}
```

#### Phase: Ops (Build)

- **Reads**: Project source, build configuration
- **Executes**: Clean build from branch HEAD
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/deploys/build-{timestamp}.log`
- **Validation**: Build artifacts exist, size is non-zero, checksums recorded

#### Phase: Ops (Deploy)

- **Reads**: Build artifacts, deploy/config.yaml
- **Executes**: Deploy command sequence per configured strategy
- **Produces**: `_aegis-output/deploys/deploy-{timestamp}.log`
- **Strategies supported**:
  - `rolling`: Gradual replacement of instances
  - `blue-green`: Deploy to inactive environment, swap traffic
  - `canary`: Deploy to small percentage, monitor, then full rollout

#### Phase: Ops (Health Check)

- **Executes within 60 seconds of deploy**:
  - HTTP endpoint check (GET /health, expect 200)
  - Process check (expected services running)
  - Log scan (no FATAL, PANIC, or unhandled exception in last 60s)
  - Custom checks from deploy/health-checks.yaml
- **On healthy**: Proceed to monitor phase
- **On unhealthy**: Immediate rollback (no human approval needed)

#### Phase: Ops (Monitor)

- **Duration**: 5 minutes post-deploy
- **Checks every 30 seconds**: Error rate from logs or metrics endpoint
- **Baseline**: Error rate from previous deploy's monitor report
- **Thresholds**:
  - error_rate <= 1.5x baseline: STABLE
  - error_rate > 1.5x baseline: WARNING (alert Navi, continue monitoring)
  - error_rate > 2x baseline: AUTO-ROLLBACK (trigger rollback phase)

#### Phase: Bolt (Hotfix -- conditional)

- **Triggered only when**: Ops detects error spike and identifies a code-level root cause
- **Reads**: Error logs, stack traces, affected code
- **Produces**: Minimal fix (smallest possible change to resolve the issue)
- **Constraint**: Hotfix goes through expedited Gate 1 (Vigil review) before redeploy. Gate 2 (QA) is deferred to next sprint but a regression test is added immediately.

## 5. Handoff Protocol

### HandoffEnvelope Schema

Every team-to-team transition uses this standardized envelope format. The envelope is
written as a JSON file to `_aegis-brain/handoffs/` and referenced in the task's history.md.

```json
{
  "envelope_id": "HO-20260325-001",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-25T14:30:00Z",
  "from_team": "build",
  "to_team": "qa",
  "task_id": "PROJ-T-042",
  "sprint": "sprint-1",
  "status": "READY_FOR_QA",
  "artifacts": {
    "spec": "_aegis-output/specs/PROJ-T-042-spec.md",
    "code_files": [
      "src/auth/middleware.ts",
      "src/auth/middleware.test.ts"
    ],
    "review": "_aegis-output/reviews/PROJ-T-042-review.md"
  },
  "gate_results": {
    "gate_1": {
      "verdict": "PASS",
      "reviewer": "vigil",
      "timestamp": "2026-03-25T14:28:00Z",
      "report": "_aegis-output/reviews/PROJ-T-042-review.md"
    },
    "gate_2": null,
    "gate_3": null
  },
  "notes": "Rate limit added per Vigil finding F-003. Ready for QA.",
  "priority": "high",
  "blocking": false
}
```

### Handoff Storage

```
_aegis-brain/
  handoffs/
    HO-20260325-001.json
    HO-20260325-002.json
    ...
```

### Handoff Lifecycle

```
1. Sending team completes its work
2. Sending team writes HandoffEnvelope to _aegis-brain/handoffs/
3. Sending team updates task meta.json (status change)
4. Sending team appends HANDOFF row to task history.md:
   | 2026-03-25 14:30 | vigil | HANDOFF | IN_REVIEW | QA | HO-20260325-001 |
5. Receiving team reads the handoff envelope
6. Receiving team validates all required artifacts exist (file checks)
7. If validation fails: receiving team rejects handoff, sets status back, notifies sender
8. If validation passes: receiving team begins its workflow
```

### Handoff Routing Table

| From Team | To Team | Trigger Condition | Status Transition |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| build | qa | Gate 1 PASS | IN_REVIEW -> QA |
| build | build | Gate 1 FAIL | IN_REVIEW -> IN_PROGRESS |
| review | qa | Deep review PASS | IN_REVIEW -> QA |
| review | build | Deep review FAIL | IN_REVIEW -> IN_PROGRESS |
| qa | compliance | Gate 2 PASS | QA -> DONE |
| qa | build | Gate 2 FAIL | QA -> IN_PROGRESS |
| compliance | devops | Gate 3 PASS | DONE -> DEPLOY_READY |
| compliance | compliance | Gate 3 FAIL | DONE (blocked) |
| devops | navi | Deploy stable | DEPLOY_READY -> RELEASED |
| devops | build | Hotfix needed | Creates new CRITICAL task |
| feedback | navi | Error spike | Creates new CRITICAL task |

### Handoff Validation Rules

The receiving team MUST validate before starting work:

1. All artifact file paths in the envelope exist on disk.
2. The task's meta.json status matches the expected incoming status.
3. All prerequisite gate results are present (e.g., QA team requires gate_1 PASS).
4. The task's sprint matches the active sprint (or is a hotfix with CRITICAL priority).

If any validation fails, the receiving team writes a rejection:

```json
{
  "envelope_id": "HO-20260325-001",
  "rejected": true,
  "rejected_by": "sentinel",
  "reason": "Artifact missing: _aegis-output/reviews/PROJ-T-042-review.md not found",
  "action": "Returned to build team for re-review"
}
```

### Handoff ID Generation

Handoff IDs follow the pattern: `HO-{YYYYMMDD}-{NNN}` where NNN is a daily sequential
counter stored in `_aegis-brain/counters.json` under the key `handoff_daily_{date}`.

## 6. Feedback Loop

### Production Issue Detection Flow

```
MONITOR (Ops watching post-deploy)
  |
  +--- Error rate > 2x baseline
  |    |
  |    v
  |  AUTO-ROLLBACK (Ops)
  |    |
  |    v
  |  CREATE CORRECTION REGISTER (Ops -> Scribe: PM.03)
  |    |
  |    v
  |  CREATE HOTFIX TASK (Ops -> Navi)
  |    |
  |    +---> CRITICAL priority
  |    +---> Auto-added to current sprint backlog
  |    +---> If Bolt is free: immediate assignment
  |    +---> If Bolt is busy: preempts current task (CRITICAL > all)
  |    |
  |    v
  |  HOTFIX CYCLE:
  |    Bolt writes fix -> Vigil expedited review (Gate 1 only)
  |    -> Ops redeploys -> Monitor again
  |    -> If stable: hotfix task DONE
  |    -> If unstable: escalate to human
  |
  +--- Error rate 1.5x-2x baseline (WARNING)
  |    |
  |    v
  |  ALERT to Navi (StatusUpdate with severity=high)
  |    |
  |    v
  |  Navi decides: wait (may stabilize) OR create investigation task (medium priority)
  |
  +--- Error rate <= 1.5x baseline
       |
       v
     STABLE -- no action needed
```

### Hotfix Task Creation (by Ops)

When Ops detects a production issue requiring a code fix:

```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_HOTFIX_TASK",
  "created_by": "ops",
  "task": {
    "id": "auto-generated via counters.json",
    "title": "HOTFIX: {error description}",
    "type": "task",

### Correction Register Entry (PM.03)

Scribe generates a Correction Register entry for every production issue:

```
| Date | ID | Source | Description | Severity | Status | Resolution | Resolved |
|------|----|--------|-------------|----------|--------|------------|----------|
| 2026-03-25 | CR-005 | Production monitor | TypeError in /api/users/:id after v1.3.0 deploy | CRITICAL | OPEN | Rollback + hotfix PROJ-T-099 | pending |
```

### Priority Escalation Rules

| Error Rate vs Baseline | Severity | Auto-Action |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| <= 1.5x | LOW | Log only, no task created |
| 1.5x - 2x | HIGH | Alert Navi, investigation task (medium priority) |
| > 2x | CRITICAL | Auto-rollback + hotfix task (critical priority, immediate assign to Bolt) |
| > 5x | EMERGENCY | Auto-rollback + human notification + all agents paused |

### Feedback Data Flow

```

## 7. Gate Summary Matrix

### All Gates at a Glance

| Gate | Name | Owner | Applies To | Criteria | On FAIL |
|------|------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Code Quality | Vigil | All tasks | Correctness, security, performance, style, tests | -> IN_PROGRESS |
| 1+ | Deep Review | Vigil + Havoc + Forge | Tasks >= 8pts or security-labeled | Enhanced review with scan data and adversarial analysis | -> IN_PROGRESS |
| 2 | Product Quality | Sentinel + Probe | Tasks >= 3pts | P0 100%, overall >= 95%, 0 regressions | -> IN_PROGRESS |
| 3 | Compliance | Scribe | Sprint close / release | All ISO docs current, traceability complete | Block sprint close |
| 4 | Deploy Health | Ops | Every deployment | HTTP 200, process alive, no FATAL logs, 60s timeout | Auto-rollback |
| 5 | Post-Deploy Monitor | Ops | Every deployment | Error rate < 2x baseline for 5 minutes | Auto-rollback + hotfix |

### Gate Skip Rules

| Condition | Gates Applied |
|-----------|--------------|
| Task < 3 story points | Gate 1 only |
| Task 3-7 story points | Gates 1, 2, 3 |
| Task >= 8 story points | Gates 1+, 2, 3 |
| Hotfix (critical) | Gate 1 (expedited) + Gate 4 + Gate 5 |
| Release | Gates 1-5 (all) |

## 8. Implementation Guidance for Bolt

This section lists the concrete files Bolt must create or modify to implement this spec.

### New Files to Create

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.claude/agents/ops.md` | Ops agent persona (Section 2 of this spec) |
| `deploy/config.yaml.template` | Deploy configuration template with environment, strategy, target |
| `deploy/health-checks.yaml.template` | Health check definitions template |
| `_aegis-brain/handoffs/.gitkeep` | Handoff envelope storage directory |
| `.claude/commands/aegis-deploy.md` | Deploy command: build, deploy, health check, monitor |
| `.claude/commands/aegis-release.md` | Release command: tag, notes, trigger deploy pipeline |
| `skills/devops-pipeline.md` | DevOps skill definition for skill catalog |

### Files to Modify

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_agents.md` | Add Ops agent (entry 13) to roster, model routing table, spawning section |
| `CLAUDE_skills.md` | Add devops-pipeline skill (entry 28) |
| `.claude/agents/mother-brain.md` | Add deploy/release to decision matrix, add Gate 4+5, add feedback loop |
| `.claude/commands/aegis-team-build.md` | Add handoff envelope generation after Vigil review |
| `.claude/commands/aegis-qa.md` | Add handoff envelope consumption and generation |
| `.claude/commands/aegis-sprint.md` | Add release/deploy stages to sprint close flow |
| `.claude/commands/aegis-compliance.md` | Add Gate 3 handoff envelope generation |

### Handoff Envelope Implementation

Add to `_aegis-brain/counters.json`:

```json
{
  "handoff_sequence": 0
}
```

Handoff ID generation: read counters.json, increment `handoff_sequence`, write back,
format as `HO-{YYYYMMDD}-{sequence padded to 3 digits}`.

### Meta.json Status Extension

The task status enum gains two new values:

```
BACKLOG -> TODO -> IN_PROGRESS -> IN_REVIEW -> QA -> DONE -> DEPLOY_READY -> RELEASED
```

New statuses:
- `DEPLOY_READY`: All 3 gates passed, awaiting deployment
- `RELEASED`: Deployed to production and stable

These are optional -- tasks that do not go through deploy (e.g., docs, config) skip directly
from DONE to the sprint close flow.

### Deploy Config Schema

```yaml
# deploy/config.yaml
environments:
  staging:
    target: "staging.example.com"
    strategy: "rolling"
    health_endpoint: "https://staging.example.com/health"
    health_timeout_seconds: 60
    monitor_duration_seconds: 300
    error_rate_baseline: 0.02

  production:
    target: "prod.example.com"
    strategy: "blue-green"
    health_endpoint: "https://prod.example.com/health"
    health_timeout_seconds: 60
    monitor_duration_seconds: 300
    error_rate_baseline: 0.015
    requires_approval: true

rollback:
  automatic: true
  max_attempts: 2
```

### Health Check Schema

```yaml
# deploy/health-checks.yaml
checks:
  - name: "HTTP Health"
    type: "http"
    url: "${HEALTH_ENDPOINT}"
    expected_status: 200
    timeout_ms: 5000
    retries: 3

  - name: "Process Check"
    type: "process"
    process_name: "node"
    expected_count: 1

  - name: "Log Scan"
    type: "log"
    path: "/var/log/app/error.log"
    forbidden_patterns: ["FATAL", "PANIC", "Unhandled"]
    window_seconds: 60
```

## Trade-offs and Alternatives Considered

### Trade-off 1: Ops as Separate Agent vs. Extending Bolt

**Chosen**: Separate Ops agent.
**Rationale**: Bolt's blast radius is application source code. Deploy and infrastructure
require different permissions (write to deploy/, ci/, docker/ but NOT src/). Mixing these
responsibilities violates the principle of least privilege. A separate agent also allows
Ops to run concurrently with Bolt on different tasks.
**Risk**: One more agent increases context cost. Mitigated by: Ops is sonnet tier (moderate
cost) and only spawns when deploy/release is needed, not for every task.

### Trade-off 2: Handoff Envelopes vs. Status-Only Transitions

**Chosen**: Full handoff envelopes with artifact references.
**Rationale**: Status flags (meta.json status change) tell you WHAT happened but not WHERE
the artifacts are or WHAT the gate result was. Handoff envelopes carry forward all context
the receiving team needs, preventing re-scanning and reducing context waste.
**Risk**: More files in _aegis-brain/handoffs/. Mitigated by: envelopes are small JSON files
and can be pruned after sprint close.

### Trade-off 3: 5 Gates vs. 3 Gates

**Chosen**: 5 gates (extending v7.0's 3-gate system with Deploy Health and Post-Deploy Monitor).
**Rationale**: The existing 3 gates cover code quality, product quality, and compliance, but
they all operate pre-deploy. Adding gates 4 and 5 extends quality assurance into production,
closing the gap between "tests pass" and "actually works in production."
**Risk**: More ceremony per release. Mitigated by: Gates 4 and 5 are fully automated (Ops
handles them without human input) and add only ~6 minutes to the deploy cycle.

---

**End of Specification**

**Next Steps**:
1. Havoc or Vigil reviews this spec for gaps, edge cases, and overlooked failure modes.
2. After review PASS, Bolt implements the files listed in Section 8.
3. Mother Brain's decision matrix is updated to include the new pipeline stages.
