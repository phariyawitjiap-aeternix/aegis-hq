# SI.03 Traceability Matrix

## 1. Purpose

This matrix traces each functional requirement (SI.01) to its design element (SI.02), implementation files, and test cases (SI.04). Ensures no requirement is unimplemented or untested.

## 2. Requirement → Design → Implementation → Test

| Req ID | Requirement | Design Element | Implementation File(s) | Test Case(s) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| FR-01 | Agent roster and routing (12 agents) | Layer 1: Agent Personas | CLAUDE_agents.md | TC-01 |
| FR-02 | Skill command system (27 skills) | Layer 2: Skill Commands | CLAUDE_skills.md | TC-02 |
| FR-03 | Session lifecycle (start → work → retro) | PM State Machine | CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE_skills.md | TC-03 |
| FR-04 | Persistent memory (_aegis-brain/) | Layer 4: Agent Memory | _aegis-brain/*.json | TC-04 |
| FR-05 | Three-gate quality system | Layer 3: Quality Gates | CLAUDE_agents.md (Vigil, Sentinel, Havoc) | TC-05 |
| FR-06 | PM State Machine | PM State Machine (SI.02 §3) | _aegis-brain/pm-state.json, CLAUDE_skills.md | TC-06 |
| FR-07 | ISO 29110 compliance docs (11 docs) | Layer 6: ISO Compliance | _aegis-output/iso-docs/ | TC-07 |
| FR-08 | Autonomy levels (L1/L2/L3) | Mother Brain, /aegis-mode | CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE_agents.md | TC-08 |
| FR-09 | Mother Brain orchestration | Decision Matrix (SI.02 §4) | CLAUDE_agents.md (Mother Brain) | TC-09 |
| FR-10 | tmux optional / in-process fallback | Layer 0: Framework Core | CLAUDE.md, GETTING_STARTED.md | TC-10 |
| NFR-01 | Zero external runtime dependencies | All layers (no imports) | All CLAUDE*.md, _aegis-brain/ | TC-11 |
| NFR-02 | Token efficiency (model routing) | Layer 1: Model tier assignment | CLAUDE_agents.md | TC-12 |
| NFR-03 | Portability | Layer 0: plain file approach | All *.md, *.json | TC-13 |
| NFR-04 | Graceful degradation | Skill error handling | CLAUDE_skills.md | TC-14 |
| NFR-05 | Audit trail | Layer 4 + Layer 5 | _aegis-brain/, _aegis-output/ | TC-15 |
| NFR-06 | Bilingual operator interface | Muse agent, language rules | CLAUDE_agents.md (Muse) | TC-16 |
| NFR-07 | Version compatibility | CLAUDE.md version header | CLAUDE.md | TC-17 |

| Layer 5: Output Artifacts | NFR-05 |
| Layer 6: ISO Compliance | FR-07 |
| PM State Machine | FR-06, FR-03 |
| Decision Matrix | FR-09 |
| tmux/in-process dual mode | FR-10 |

## 4. Implementation File → Requirements Coverage

## 5. Coverage Summary

| Category | Total | Covered | Gap |
|----------|-------|---------|-----|
| Functional Requirements | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Non-Functional Requirements | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| Design Elements | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Implementation Files | 11 | 11 | 0 |

**Coverage: 100% — No untraced requirements.**

## 6. Open Traceability Issues

| ID | Issue | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| TI-01 | Automated traceability checking (script to verify matrix against actual files) | Open — planned for v7.2 |
| TI-02 | NFR-02 (token efficiency) — no automated cost measurement yet | Open — planned for v7.2 |
