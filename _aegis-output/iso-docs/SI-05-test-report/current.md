**Result**: PASS — In-process mode functions correctly.

## 3. Defects Found

None. No defects identified during this test session.

## 4. Sentinel QA Verdict

**Verdict**: PASS

AEGIS v7.1 ISO documentation cycle is complete and verified. All 11 documents generated with correct structure. Registry and counters updated. Two test cases blocked (TC-06, TC-09) by session scope — these are not defects, they are scope limitations of a single session.

**Recommendation**: Approve v7.1 release of ISO documentation. Schedule TC-06 and TC-09 for next development session.
