# SI.06 Acceptance Record

## 1. Purpose

This document records the formal acceptance status of each AEGIS version, documenting what was accepted, who accepted it, and any conditions or deficiencies noted at acceptance.

A version is considered accepted when:
1. All P0 and P1 issues are resolved
2. All structural tests pass (TC-01–TC-04 equivalent)
3. Operator has validated the version in at least one real work session
4. Retrospective has been written and lessons captured
5. CLAUDE.md version header is updated

### v6.0 — Foundation Release

**Date Accepted**: 2025-Q4
**Accepted By**: Human Operator (Primary)
**Acceptance Verdict**: Accepted with conditions

**What Was Delivered**:
- 8 agent personas (Navi, Sage, Bolt, Vigil, Havoc, Forge, Pixel, Muse)
- ~20 slash command skills
- _aegis-brain/ directory with 10 JSON memory files
- tmux-based multi-agent orchestration
- CLAUDE_safety.md permission model
- Session lifecycle (/aegis-start, /aegis-retro)

**What Was Tested**:
- Manual: All 8 agents invocable by name
- Manual: /aegis-start produced status report
- Manual: /aegis-retro produced retro document
- Manual: Brain files persisted across 3 test sessions

**Conditions at Acceptance**:
- CON-01: tmux dependency required for team orchestration — workaround: operator must install tmux
- CON-02: No PM state persistence — operator must re-establish context manually each session
- CON-03: No QA agents — quality gates enforced manually

**Post-v6.0 Actions**:
- CON-01 → CR-001 (tmux optional) — resolved in v7.0
- CON-02 → CR-004 (PM state persistence) — resolved in v7.0
- CON-03 → Sentinel + Probe agents added in v7.0

### v7.0 — Enterprise Release

**Date Accepted**: 2026-Q1
**Accepted By**: Human Operator (Primary) + Navi (Lead Agent)
**Acceptance Verdict**: Accepted

**What Was Delivered**:
- 4 new agents: Sentinel (QA Lead), Probe (QA Executor), Scribe (Compliance), Mother Brain
- 3-gate quality system (Vigil → Sentinel → Havoc)
- PM State Machine (planning → in-process → review → retro)
- pm-state.json persistence
- ISO 29110 scaffolding (doc-registry.json, counters.json)
- 7 new skills (PM: 3, QA: 3, Docs: 2)
- GETTING_STARTED.md
- In-process mode as default (CR-001)
- Terminology: "cycle" replaces "loop" (CR-002)
- Planning gate before build (CR-003)

**What Was Tested**:
- Manual: All 12 agents invocable
- Manual: 3-gate pipeline executed end-to-end on one change set
- Manual: PM state transitions through full cycle (planning → retro)
- Manual: In-process mode (without tmux) — session completed
- Manual: Mother Brain scanned project and produced plan without human prompting

**Conditions at Acceptance**:
- CON-04: ISO 29110 documents scaffolded but not generated — Scribe defined but not yet used
- CON-05: No automated test harness — all testing manual

**Post-v7.0 Actions**:
- CON-04 → SI.01–SI.07 + PM.01–PM.04 generation — resolved in v7.1 (this session)
- CON-05 → Planned for v7.2

### v7.1 — ISO Documentation Release

**Date Accepted**: 2026-03-24
**Accepted By**: Human Operator (Primary) + Sentinel (QA Lead)
**Acceptance Verdict**: Accepted

**What Was Delivered**:
- 11 ISO 29110 Basic Profile documents (PM.01–PM.04, SI.01–SI.07)
  - Each with v1.md, current.md, changelog.md
- doc-registry.json updated (11 entries)
- counters.json DOC counter = 11

**What Was Tested**:
- TC-01: Agent roster — PASS (12 agents)
- TC-02: Skill commands — PASS (27 skills)
- TC-03: Brain directory — PASS (10 files)
- TC-04: ISO doc structure — PASS (11 dirs, 33 files)
- TC-05: Session lifecycle — PASS
- TC-13: Registry completeness — PASS
- TC-14: Header conformance — PASS
- TC-15: Counter accuracy — PASS (DOC=11)
- TC-16: In-process mode — PASS

**Conditions at Acceptance**:
- CON-06: TC-06 (/aegis-retro) and TC-09 (state persistence) blocked — not defects, scope-limited to single session
- CON-07: No automated regression for ISO docs — manual verification only

**Post-v7.1 Actions**:
- CON-06 → Verify TC-06 and TC-09 in next development session
- CON-07 → Automated traceability check planned for v7.2
