# Autonomy Levels — Graduated Agent Autonomy System

> Defines how much independence agents have at each level, and how to transition between levels.

## Overview

The AEGIS framework supports four autonomy levels. Higher levels give agents more freedom; lower levels keep humans more involved. The right level depends on project maturity, trust, and risk tolerance.

## Level Definitions

### L1 — Supervised
**Human approves every action.**

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Planning | Human approves plan before agents start |
| Execution | Each agent step requires human confirmation |
| Review | Human reviews all outputs |
| Deployment | Human-only |
| Best for | New projects, unfamiliar codebases, high-risk changes |

Agent behavior at L1:
- Present every action as an ApprovalRequest before executing
- Wait for explicit human "proceed" before continuing
- No autonomous file modifications
- All outputs are drafts until human-approved

### L2 — Guided
**Human approves plans, agents execute steps.**

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Planning | Human approves the PlanProposal |
| Execution | Agents execute steps independently within the approved plan |
| Review | Vigil reviews, human spot-checks |
| Deployment | Human approves final output |
| Best for | Established projects, well-defined tasks, moderate risk |

Agent behavior at L2:
- Navi presents a PlanProposal for human approval
- Once approved, agents execute without per-step confirmation
- Agents still report progress via StatusUpdate
- Deviations from plan require re-approval
- Final deliverables require human sign-off

### L3 — Autonomous
**Agents operate freely, human reviews final output.**

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Planning | Agents plan and execute independently |
| Execution | Full agent autonomy within scope constraints |
| Review | Agent consensus (2+ agents agree) sufficient |
| Deployment | Human reviews final output before deploy |
| Best for | Trusted workflows, low-risk tasks, experienced teams |

Agent behavior at L3:
- Navi assigns tasks without waiting for human plan approval
- Agents execute and review using standard protocols
- QualityGate consensus is sufficient for internal approvals
- Only the final deliverable goes to human for review
- EscalationAlerts still go to human when triggered

### L4 — Full Auto
**Fully autonomous with async monitoring.**

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Planning | Fully autonomous |
| Execution | Fully autonomous |
| Review | Fully autonomous (agent consensus) |
| Deployment | Autonomous with monitoring |
| Best for | CI/CD pipelines, automated maintenance, batch processing |

Agent behavior at L4:
- Complete end-to-end execution without human involvement
- Human receives SessionSummary asynchronously
- Automatic rollback on QualityGate FAIL
- Monitoring alerts sent to human only for critical issues
- Human can interrupt at any time

## Setting the Autonomy Level

```
/aegis-mode --autonomy L3
```

- Default after `/aegis-start`: **L3 (Autonomous) — Mother Brain active**
- Mother Brain scans project → decides → acts without asking human
- Human can downgrade: `/aegis-mode --autonomy L1` (manual mode)
- Navi stores the current level in `_aegis-brain/config/autonomy.json`

## Mother Brain (L3/L4 Autonomous Controller)

When autonomy is L3 or L4, Mother Brain (`🧬`) takes control:
- Scans project state automatically (git, tests, specs, deps, debt)
- Applies Decision Matrix (P0-P10) to pick highest-priority action
- Spawns the right team via tmux without asking
- Reports decisions with rationale (transparent, not secretive)
- Human watches via `tmux attach -t aegis-team` and interrupts if needed
- Only asks human for P10 (completely empty project with no identity)

See `.claude/agents/mother-brain.md` for full protocol.

## Escalation Rules

Any agent can request escalation (moving to a lower level for more oversight):

```
--- EscalationAlert ---
From: [agent]
To: 🧭 Navi
...
Suggested action: Downgrade autonomy to L[N] for [scope]
---
```

Escalation scenarios:
- Unexpected error in a critical path
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Agent disagreement that consensus cannot resolve
- Context budget emergency
- Task scope exceeds agent capabilities

## Auto-Downgrade

The system automatically drops one autonomy level when:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| QualityGate FAIL with critical findings | Drop one level |
| EscalationAlert with severity: critical | Drop one level |
| 2+ consecutive task failures | Drop one level |
| Context emergency (80%+ usage) | Drop to L1 |

**Recovery**: After human confirms the issue is resolved, autonomy returns to its previous level. Navi logs the downgrade and recovery in the session summary.

## Level Transitions

```
L4 ──[error]──▶ L3 ──[error]──▶ L2 ──[error]──▶ L1
L1 ──[human confirms]──▶ L2 ──[human confirms]──▶ L3 ──[human confirms]──▶ L4
```

- Downgrade: automatic, immediate
- Upgrade: requires explicit human confirmation
- Level changes are logged in `_aegis-brain/logs/activity.log`
- Navi announces level changes to all agents via broadcast
