# /aegis-compliance -- ISO 29110 Compliance Management

## Purpose
Generate, audit, and maintain ISO/IEC 29110 Basic profile work products using the Scribe sub-agent. Ensures all required compliance documents exist, are current, and maintain full traceability from requirements through to test results.

## Subcommands

### /aegis-compliance generate
Generate all missing or outdated ISO 29110 documents from current project state.

**Flow**:
1. Scan _aegis-output/iso-docs/ for existing documents
2. Scan _aegis-output/ and _aegis-brain/ for source data
3. Identify which documents can be generated (source data exists)
4. Read `_aegis-output/iso-docs/doc-registry.json` (create with empty array if missing)
5. Read `_aegis-brain/counters.json` (create with counters at 0 if missing)
6. For each document to generate, follow the **Versioning Protocol**:
   - **New document** (not in doc-registry):
     a. Generate `PROJ-DOC-NNN` ID via counter protocol (increment DOC counter)
     b. Create directory: `_aegis-output/iso-docs/{doc-type-slug}/`
     c. Write content to `v1.md`
     d. Copy `v1.md` content to `current.md`
     e. Create `changelog.md` with initial entry:
        ```
        # Changelog: {document title}

        ## v1 (YYYY-MM-DD)
        - Initial version created
        - Author: scribe
        ```
     f. Add document entry to `doc-registry.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "id": "PROJ-DOC-NNN",
          "type": "XX.NN",
          "title": "Document Title",
          "current_version": 1,
          "status": "Draft",
          "author": "scribe",
          "reviewer": null,
          "created": "YYYY-MM-DD",
          "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
          "path": "_aegis-output/iso-docs/{doc-type-slug}/"
        }
        ```
   - **Existing document** (found in doc-registry):
     a. Read current_version from registry entry
     b. Increment version: `N+1 = current_version + 1`
     c. Write new content to `v{N+1}.md`
     d. Overwrite `current.md` with new content
     e. Append to `changelog.md`:
        ```
        ## v{N+1} (YYYY-MM-DD)
        - {summary of changes from diff with previous version}
        - Author: scribe
        ```
     f. Update registry entry: set `current_version`, `last_updated`, `status`
7. Update traceability matrix after all documents generated
8. Report summary: generated (new), updated (versioned), skipped (no source data), already current

### /aegis-compliance check
Audit which ISO 29110 documents are missing, outdated, or incomplete.

**Flow**:
1. Read the full ISO 29110 Basic profile document catalog (PM.01-PM.04, SI.01-SI.07)
2. Read `_aegis-output/iso-docs/doc-registry.json` for version and status info
3. Check _aegis-output/iso-docs/ for each required document
4. For existing documents, check if source data has changed since last generation
5. Cross-reference registry entries for version info (current_version, last_updated, status)
6. Report:
   - Missing documents (required but not generated)
   - Outdated documents (source data newer than document)
   - Current documents (up to date)
   - Compliance score: X/11 documents current

**Output format**:
```

Registry: doc-registry.json has N entries, last updated YYYY-MM-DD
Action: Run /aegis-compliance generate to fix gaps.
```

### /aegis-compliance matrix
Show or update the traceability matrix that links requirements to design, code, and tests.

**Flow**:
1. Read requirements from _aegis-output/breakdown/ and iso-docs/requirements-spec.md
2. Read design references from iso-docs/design-doc.md
3. Read code references from Bolt implementation records
4. Read test cases from _aegis-output/qa/
5. Read test results from _aegis-output/qa/results/
6. Compute the cross-reference matrix
7. Write to _aegis-output/iso-docs/traceability-matrix.md
8. Report gaps (requirements without tests, code without design refs, etc.)

### /aegis-compliance history DOC-TYPE
Show the changelog for a specific document type.

**Flow**:
1. Map DOC-TYPE to the document slug (e.g., `PM.01` -> `PM-01-project-plan`)
2. If DOC-TYPE not recognized, show available document types from doc-registry.json
3. Read `_aegis-output/iso-docs/{doc-type-slug}/changelog.md`
4. If changelog does not exist, report "No changelog found for {DOC-TYPE}. Document may not have been generated yet."
5. Display the full changelog contents

**Output format**:
```

### /aegis-compliance diff DOC-TYPE [v1] [v2]
Show diff between two versions of a document.

**Flow**:
1. Map DOC-TYPE to the document slug
2. If DOC-TYPE not recognized, show available document types from doc-registry.json
3. Determine version numbers:
   - If both v1 and v2 provided: compare those specific versions
   - If only v1 provided: compare v1 with current (latest) version
   - If neither provided: compare previous version (N-1) with current version (N)
4. Read `_aegis-output/iso-docs/{doc-type-slug}/v{A}.md` and `v{B}.md`
5. If either version file does not exist, report error with available versions
6. Compute line-by-line diff between the two versions
7. Display diff with additions (+) and removals (-)

**Output format**:
```

## Agent Routing
- **Primary**: Scribe (generates all documents)
- **Assist**: Muse (prose-heavy sections if needed)
- **Data source**: All other agents' outputs (Sage, Bolt, Vigil, Sentinel, Probe)

## Output Location
_aegis-output/iso-docs/

## Quality Gate
This command feeds into Gate 3 (Compliance) of the 3-gate quality system:
- Gate 1: Code Quality (Vigil) -- code review, lint, standards
- Gate 2: Product Quality (Sentinel) -- functional tests, acceptance criteria
- Gate 3: Compliance (Scribe) -- all required ISO docs exist and are current

Sprint close is blocked until Gate 3 passes (/aegis-compliance check shows 11/11 current).
