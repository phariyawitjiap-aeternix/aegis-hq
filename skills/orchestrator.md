## Quick Reference
Dual-mode multi-agent orchestration engine for AEGIS.
- **Mode 1 — Subagent**: Sequential agent calls within single Claude session
- **Mode 2 — Agent Team (tmux)**: Parallel agents in separate tmux panes
- **Auto-select**: Simple tasks → Subagent; Complex/parallel → Agent Team
- **Review gates**: Phase transitions require quality checks before proceeding
- **Context budget**: Monitor token usage, compress when approaching limits
- **tmux required**: Agent Teams run in tmux panes — tmux is a core dependency, not optional
- **Output**: Task status logged to `_aegis-brain/logs/activity.log`

## Full Instructions

### Mode Selection Logic

```
IF task.complexity == "simple" OR task.agents <= 2:
    mode = "subagent"
ELIF tmux_available():
    mode = "agent-team"
ELSE:
    mode = "subagent"  # fallback
    log_warning("tmux unavailable, falling back to subagent mode")
```

### Subagent Mode

Sequential execution within a single session. Best for:
- Tasks requiring 1-2 agents
- Linear workflows (A → B → C)
- Quick operations under 5 minutes

**Protocol:**
1. Parse task into subtasks
2. Assign persona to each subtask (see ai-personas.md)
3. Execute sequentially, passing context between steps
4. Apply review gate after each phase
5. Aggregate results and report

### Agent Team Mode (tmux)

Parallel execution across tmux panes. Best for:
- Tasks requiring 3+ agents
- Independent parallel workstreams
- Long-running operations

**Protocol:**
1. Parse task into independent workstreams
2. Load team config from `.claude/teams/` if applicable
3. Create tmux session: `tmux new-session -d -s aegis-<task-id>`
4. Spawn agent per pane with persona context
5. Monitor progress via structured status messages
6. Collect results at synchronization points
7. Apply review gates before phase transitions
8. Synthesize final output

### Task Decomposition

1. **Analyze** the user request for scope and complexity
2. **Identify** required personas based on task patterns
3. **Determine** dependencies between subtasks
4. **Create** execution plan:
   ```
   Task: <description>
   Mode: subagent | agent-team
   Agents: [list]
   Phases:
     1. <phase> → Agent: <persona> → Gate: <yes/no>
     2. <phase> → Agent: <persona> → Gate: <yes/no>
   Expected Output: <location>
   ```

### Review Gates

Gates are checkpoints between phases. A gate evaluates the output of the previous phase before allowing the next phase to begin.

**Gate Types:**
| Gate | Criteria | Pass Condition |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Quality Gate | Code review findings | 0 critical findings |
| Spec Gate | Spec completeness check | All sections filled |
| Test Gate | Test results | All tests pass |
| Security Gate | Security scan | 0 high/critical vulns |
| Approval Gate | Human review | Explicit approval |

**Gate Protocol:**
1. Previous phase agent produces output
2. Gate evaluator (usually Vigil) reviews output
3. Result: PASS / FAIL / CONDITIONAL
4. PASS → proceed to next phase
5. FAIL → return to previous agent with feedback
6. CONDITIONAL → flag for human decision

### Context Budget Management

Monitor token usage to prevent context overflow:

1. **Track** cumulative tokens per session
2. **Warn** at 60% capacity: compress non-essential context
3. **Compress** at 80% capacity: summarize completed phases, drop raw data
4. **Emergency** at 90%: archive to `_aegis-brain/learnings/`, start fresh sub-session

**Compression Strategy:**
- Replace detailed code with file paths + line references
- Summarize completed phase outputs into 3-5 bullet points
- Keep only active phase context in full detail
- Preserve all gate decisions (never compress these)

### Communication Protocol

Agents communicate via structured message types:

| Type | From | To | Purpose |
|------|------|----|---------|
| TaskAssignment | Navi | Agent | Assign work |
| StatusUpdate | Agent | Navi | Progress report |
| FindingReport | Vigil/Havoc | Lead | Quality/security findings |
| PlanProposal | Sage | Team | Architecture proposal |
| ApprovalRequest | Agent | Human | Needs human decision |
| CompletionReport | Agent | Navi | Task done |

### Error Handling

1. **Agent timeout** (>10 min no response): Log warning, reassign task
2. **Gate failure** (3 consecutive): Escalate to human with summary
3. **Context overflow**: Archive and restart with summary
4. **tmux crash**: Fall back to subagent, resume from last gate
5. **Conflicting outputs**: Invoke Navi for resolution

### Logging

All orchestration events are logged to `_aegis-brain/logs/activity.log`:
